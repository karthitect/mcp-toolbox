## About

A `bigquery-execute-sql` tool executes a SQL statement against BigQuery.

`bigquery-execute-sql` accepts the following parameters:

- **`sql`** (required): The GoogleSQL statement to execute.
- **`dry_run`** (optional): If set to `true`, the query is validated but not
  run, returning information about the execution instead. Defaults to `false`.

The behavior of this tool is influenced by the combination of the `readOnly`
and `writeMode` settings on its `bigquery` source:

| `readOnly` | `writeMode` | Tool Behavior | MCP Tool Annotations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `false` *(default)* | `allowed` *(default)* | All SQL statements are permitted. | *(Default / none)* |
| `true` | `blocked` *(default if `readOnly: true`)* | Only `SELECT` statements are allowed. Any other type of statement (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `CREATE`) will be rejected. | `readOnlyHint: true` |
| `true` | `protected` | Enables session-based execution. `SELECT` statements can be used on all tables, while write operations are allowed only for the session's temporary dataset (e.g., `CREATE TEMP TABLE ...`). | `readOnlyHint: true` |

> **Note:** Conflicting configurations, such as `readOnly: true` combined with
> `writeMode: allowed`, are rejected during server startup.

The tool's behavior is influenced by the `allowedDatasets` restriction on the
`bigquery` source. Similar to `writeMode`, this setting provides an additional
layer of security by controlling which datasets can be accessed:

- **Without `allowedDatasets` restriction:** The tool can execute any valid
  GoogleSQL query.
- **With `allowedDatasets` restriction:** Before execution, the tool performs a
  dry run to analyze the query. It will reject the query if it explicitly
  references any table outside `allowedDatasets`.

  **Authorized views are supported.** If the dry run reports that the query
  reads a table outside `allowedDatasets`, but that table is not named anywhere
  in the SQL text, the access is treated as an
  [authorized view](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/authorized-views)
  and permitted. This lets you expose a curated view in an allowed dataset that
  reads from restricted source data. Note that all table names in the query
  must be fully qualified (`dataset.table` or `project.dataset.table`) to be
  eligible for authorized view exemptions, as unqualified table names resolved
  via default datasets cannot be statically verified against `allowedDatasets`.

  To keep the analysis sound, the following operations remain disallowed:

  - **Dataset-level operations** (e.g., `CREATE SCHEMA`, `ALTER SCHEMA`).
  - **Unanalyzable operations** where the accessed tables cannot be determined
    statically (e.g., `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`, `CREATE PROCEDURE`,
    `CREATE FUNCTION`, `CREATE TABLE FUNCTION`, `CALL`).
  - **Session variable assignments** (e.g., `SET @@dataset_id = ...`).
  - **Federated queries** via `EXTERNAL_QUERY`.
  - **Region-level `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views** (only dataset-scoped views such
    as `<dataset>.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES` are allowed).

> **Note:** This tool is intended for developer assistant workflows with
> human-in-the-loop and shouldn't be used for production agents.
