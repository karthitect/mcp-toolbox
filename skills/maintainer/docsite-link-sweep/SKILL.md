description: >-
  Sweep the googleapis/mcp-toolbox docs for broken and non-canonical links, report each
  finding with its cause, and apply the safe class of internal link fixes. CI does not check
  links on this repo, so this skill is the only link check that runs. Use when a maintainer
  asks for a link sweep or a docs health check, before a release, or after a docs reorg, page
  rename, or directory move. Example requests: "check the docs for broken links", "link
  sweep", "fix the dead links in docs/". The skill edits the working tree and makes one
  commit. It never pushes, never opens a PR, and never rewrites external links or ambiguous
  targets.

# Docsite Link Sweep (mcp-toolbox)

**No link check runs in CI.** Both link checker workflows are disabled at the GitHub Actions
level, so a broken link now merges without warning and nobody files the weekly report issue.
Run this skill yourself. Nothing else catches these.

The skill drives two tools, and each one misses what the other catches:

- **Lychee** resolves a link as a filesystem path or a network URL. It knows nothing about Hugo.
- **Hugo** resolves a `.md` link to a pretty URL and generates links from shortcodes. It never checks an external URL.

The skill covers the gap. It applies safe mechanical fixes to internal links. It reports external and ambiguous failures for a maintainer to decide.

## Prerequisites

- **Clean git working tree.** Commit or stash docs changes before you start.
- **`lychee`.** Install with `brew install lychee`, or run `docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/input" lycheeverse/lychee`. Lychee is now the only external URL check anywhere in this repo. Without it, run the grep and build passes, then report that external URLs went unchecked.
- **`hugo`**, Extended v0.146.0 or later, for shortcode and build verification.

Default scope is `README.md` and `docs/en/`. Sweep the full scope by default, because no CI pass has covered these files since the workflows went dark. Narrow to the changed markdown files only when the maintainer asks to check one PR.

## References

- [`DEVELOPER.md`](references/DEVELOPER.md): canonical link rules. Its "Link Checking and Fixing with Lychee" section says the repo uses lychee for link checks. That claim is stale for CI. The link rules and the `.lycheeignore` guidance in it remain correct.
- [`references/link-forms.md`](references/link-forms.md): path-to-URL mapping, version leaks, and Hugo traps.
- [`.lycheeignore`](https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox/blob/main/.lycheeignore): excluded domains and URLs. The local lychee CLI still reads this file, so it still applies. Every entry must carry a comment.
- [`link_checker.yaml`](https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox/blob/main/.github/workflows/link_checker.yaml) and [`link_checker_report.yaml`](https://github.com/googleapis/mcp-toolbox/blob/main/.github/workflows/link_checker_report.yaml): both disabled. The YAML still declares a `pull_request` trigger and a weekly `schedule`, so read the workflow state, not the file. Check with `gh api repos/googleapis/mcp-toolbox/actions/workflows`. Treat these files as the reference for flags to reuse, not as a check that runs.

## 1. Detect

Run lychee. Keep the two `--exclude` patterns. `neo4j+` and `bolt://` are database schemes, and lychee cannot fetch them:

```bash
lychee --quiet --no-progress --exclude '^neo4j\+.*' --exclude '^bolt://.*' README.md docs/

# For a PR, limit the scope to changed files:
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACMRT origin/main...HEAD -- '*.md'
```

Then grep for the structural problems lychee cannot see:

```bash
# Directory-style links. Hugo resolves these, lychee fails them.
grep -rnE "\]\(\.\.?/[^)]*\)" docs/en --include=*.md | grep -vE "\.md(#[^)]*)?\)"

# Site-absolute links. These leak across versioned deploys.
grep -rnE "\]\(/[^)]*\)" docs/en --include=*.md

# Hardcoded domain URLs.
grep -rn "https://mcp-toolbox.dev/" docs/en --include=*.md

# Section indexes with no `type: docs`. Docsy then renders no child links.
find docs/en -name _index.md \
  -not -path '*/tools/*' -not -path '*/samples/*' -not -path '*/prebuilt-configs/*' \
  -exec grep -L "^type: docs" {} +
```

The three excluded paths hold frontmatter-only wrapper files. `CLAUDE.md` requires them to stay minimal, so they are expected hits and not findings. Without the exclusions this check returns about 58 files instead of 1.

For a deep sweep, build the site and crawl the rendered HTML. This is the only pass that sees shortcode-generated links:

```bash
cd .hugo && hugo --minify --config hugo.cloudflare.toml
lychee --offline --base-url public public
```

## 2. Classify

Fix only safe, unambiguous internal links. Report everything else.

| Category | Action | Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **Safe to fix** | Rewrite in place to a file-relative `.md` link | • Directory link<br>• Site-absolute `[Text](/path/)`<br>• Hardcoded `https://mcp-toolbox.dev/...`<br>• Moved file with exactly one obvious git successor<br>• Renamed heading anchor |
| **Needs decision** | Report with a recommendation. Do not apply. | • Target is missing or deleted<br>• Several candidate targets after a split or reorg<br>• Link points into an `ignoreFiles` path (see `hugo.toml`)<br>• `_index.md` has no `type: docs` |
| **External** | Report `file:line`, URL, and status | • External URL returns 404, 403, or 500 |
| **Ignore-worthy** | Propose a commented `.lycheeignore` regex | • Endpoint is auth-walled, rate-limited, or flaky |

**Canonical link rule:** use a file-relative path that ends in `.md`, for example `[Example](../folder/file.md)`. Never use a site-absolute `/...` path or a directory `/.../` path.

## 3. Verify

Check every modified file against both checkers:

```bash
lychee --quiet --no-progress --offline <modified-files>
cd .hugo && hugo --environment development
```

## 4. Commit and report

```bash
git checkout -b docs/fix-docsite-links
git commit -am "docs: fix broken docsite links"
```

Stop there. Print the report, then give the maintainer the push and PR commands to run.

## Rules

- **Verify both ways.** Every fix must pass offline `lychee` and `hugo --environment development`.
- **Never guess an external URL.** If an external link is dead, report it. Do not substitute a replacement.
- **Never invent a missing target.** A missing internal page belongs in "Needs your decision".
- **Canonical format only.** Use file-relative `.md`. Never add an internal link to `.lycheeignore`.
- **Propose only.** Never push a branch and never open a PR.

## Output format

**External, report only** (<count>)
| file:line | url | status |

**Proposed .lycheeignore entries** (<count>)
| pattern | reason |

**Structural** (<count>)
